# The Linked Building Data (on the Web) Community Group - lbdw
This repository is for storing the developments of the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) being developed within the auspices of the W3C Linked Building Data (on the Web) Community Group and is intended to become the core ontology for a new W3C Building Data on the Web Working Group. 

## How to Get Involved

### Web-site based Pull-Request

* [Fork](https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/lbdw#fork-destination-box) the `w3c-lbd-cg/lbdw` repository into your own account (botton in the top right corner)
* Navigate to a file in your master branch that you want to change (e.g.,  http://github.com/{your-account}/w3c-lbd-cg/lbdw/blob/master/charters/wot-ig-2016.html or http://github.com/{your-account}/wot/blob/master/charters/lbdw-wg-2016.html)
* Click the edit icon in the upper right (pen next to Raw/Blame/History)
* Make your edits (e.g., directly in the online editor or by copying the text to your favorite editor and back)
* Give a meaningful commit message (i.e., do not leave "Update ...")
* Choose *Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request* and give a proper name (e.g., `charters-ig-scope-plugfest`)
* Click *Propose file change*
* Skip the form, since you do not want to create a PR to your fork. Instead, go to https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/lbdw, where GitHub will have found your new branch and will offer to open a pull-request (base fork: `w3c/wot`, base: `master` ... head fork: `{your-account}/wot`, compare: `{your-branch}`).
* If you have a separate change proposal for the same file, go back to your master branch and repeat the process from clicking the edit icon.
* If the pull-request discussion expects you to update your change proposal, go to your branch corresponding to the PR, click the edit icon, and commit directly to that branch.

### Command-line based Pull-Request

* [Fork](https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/lbdw#fork-destination-box) the `w3c-lbd-cg/lbdw` repository into your own account
* Create a branch in your fork for one particular topic (e.g., a single IG scope item) with a proper name (e.g., `charter-ig-scope-plugfest`)
* Make your edits and commit
* Push the new branch to your own repository fork
* GitHub will automatically offer to open a pull-request to `w3c/wot` (from your new branch to master)

### Github Help
