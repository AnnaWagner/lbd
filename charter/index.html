<h1 id="title">Building Data on the Web Working Group Charter</h1>

<p>Vast amounts of heterogeneous data are generated and used during the <b>life cycle of a building</b>. An example type of data are product data, which describe the building and the elements that make up the building. These include walls, windows, pipes, ducts, light switches, sensors and other devices. Starting from these data, and through their connection to more fine-grained data, such as sensor measurements data, usage data, intelligent domotic system data, geographical data, weather data, highly advanced services can be supplied over the web to various end users.</p>
<p>The <strong>mission</strong> of the Building Data on the Web Working Group group is to clarify and formalize the relevant standards landscape for building data on the web.
In particular:</p>

<ol>
<li>to determine how building information can best be integrated with other data on the Web;</li>
<li>to determine how machines and people can discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same building, especially when 'building' is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity;</li>
<li>to identify and assess existing methods and tools and then create a set of best practices for their use;</li>
<li>where desirable, to complete the standardization of informal technologies already in widespread use.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Several data models (some of which are standards) currently exist which capture aspects of the building and support making the data available to applications. Examples are the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), SAREF, DogOnt, QUDT, etc. However, these data currently often sit in fragmented silos, making it difficult to develop applications to access and integrate them. Furthermore, where data is available, they may be represented in structures or formats which further inhibit ease of re-use, as they are not necessarily web-oriented.
</p>
<p>
  The Building Data on the Web Working Group aims to make building data better available on the web. It aims to achieve this through the development of a simplified reference building ontology which is based on existing schemas for building data. The Building Data on the Web Working Group will develop a small core set of concepts and properties which are essential for describing buildings and which can be published as reference building data on the web. This core set of concepts will focus on the <b>building topology</b> (spaces, storeys, site) and on </b>building product data</b> (walls, beams, devices). For these domains, OWL ontologies are developed, and publication strategies are proposed and recommended. Relevant other data is discussed, including geometric data, sensor data, geographic data and other data. Where possible, this Working Group will connect to existing W3C Interest Groups and Working Groups and support standards that are developed in these groups (e.g. <abbr title="Semantic Sensor Network Ontology">SSN</abbr> for sensor data).
</p>
<p>
    This approach is essential to exploiting building data on the web for a range of important use cases, including those related to indoor navigation (e.g. shop navigation, evacuation and disaster, etc.), energy efficiency simulation (e.g. retrofitting, behavioural change, etc.), web-based facility management, and many more. This data will allow building owners and companies to publish quality building data on the web in a structured way, making the development of new and novel applications possible.
</p>

        <p>The main objective of the Building Data on the Web Working Group is to enable all stakeholders in the 
            building life cycle to access and query required data to support their business use cases using web technologies. Its scope is then Web technologies as they may be applied to buildings (products, geometry, usage, topology). Infrastructure data (bridges, roads, railroads) 
        </p>
        <p>
            Where relevant, it will promote Linked Data using the 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> paradigm, but 
            this will not exclude other technologies.

The outcomes of the LDWG and this Building Data on the Web WG will nevertheless be different, as only the latter specifically aims at web-oriented data standards, which requires a different set-up than is currently in place in buildingSMART International. Strong alignment is nevertheless sought in the content. Formally, each standards body has established its own group with its own charter and operates under the respective organization's rules of membership. The two groups will work together very closely and create a set of outputs that are complementary in purpose and nature (oriented either towards a web development market or towards the construction industry market), and that are expected to be adopted as standards by W3C and buildingSMART separately.</p>

      <p>
        To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <i class="todo"><a href="">Working Group home page</a></i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[email-list]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/">archive</a>)
          <i class="todo">or</i> on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
