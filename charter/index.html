<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Vast amounts of heterogeneous data are generated and used during the <b>life cycle of a building</b>. 
  An example is product data, which describe the building and the elements that make up the building. 
  Product data includes walls, windows, pipes, ducts, light switches, sensors and other devices. 
  With these data as a basis, and through their connection to more fine-grained data, such as sensor measurements data, 
  usage data, intelligent domotic system data, geographical data, weather data, 
  highly advanced services can be supplied over the Web to various end users.</p>

  <!--<p class="todo">(enhance this section based on feedback from industrials supporters)</p>
-->
  <p> From an industrial point of view, using Linked Data technologies and adopting common Knowledge Graph
  models are essential to exploiting building data on the web for a range of important use cases, 
  including those related to indoor navigation (e.g. shop navigation, evacuation and disaster, etc.), 
  energy efficiency simulation (e.g. retrofitting, behavioural change, etc.), 
  web-based facility management, and many more. 
  </p>
  <p></p>
  The outcomes generated by this group will support building owners and companies to publish quality building data on 
  the web in a structured way, making the development of new and novel applications possible.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 stars Linked Data paradigm</a> can be adapted for Building-related data as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using URIs as names for building-related things such as: rooms, walls, products, elements, 
    enable different parties to provide complementary descriptions of the same uniquely identified 
    entities in different knowledge graphs.</li>
    <li>Using HTTP URIs for these things enables the authority responsible for these URIs to provide 
    reference information about this entity when one looks it up on the Web. For example, products 
    in a catalogue, building appliances, or even the building itself.</li>
    <li>Providing information using common standards (RDF, SPARQL) and common Knowledge Graph models 
    enable semantic interoperability between data sources.</li> 
    <li>Include links to other URIs can help to discover more things, such as a link to the catalogue 
    an appliance has been chosen from, or a link to the 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#sec-servient-architecture">Web of Things Servient
    </a> that enables it to interact with this appliance.</li> 
  </ul>  

  </section>

  <section class="scope" id="scope">
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>The scope of the Linked Building Data Working Group, LBD-WG, is Linked Data models and technologies as they may be applied to Building-related information.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="out-of-scope">
    <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
    <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working Group:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>description of the geometry</li>
      <li>description of the geospatial data</li>
      <li>infrastructures (bridges, roads, tunnels, rail, ...)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="deliverables">
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>The Working group will output five main deliverables to enable interoperability of applications across the life cycle of buildings</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A project information ontology</li>
      <li>Primer documents for non-Web experts</li>
    </ul>


    <section>
      <h3>Use Cases and Requirements (Note)</h3>
      <p>A document setting out the range of problems that the working groups are trying to solve, and requirements that the different semantic models should fulfil.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Building Data on the Web Best Practices (Note)</h3>
      <p>
        Building-related data currently often sit in fragmented silos, making it difficult to develop applications to access and integrate them. Furthermore, where data is available, they may be represented in structures or formats which further inhibit ease of re-use, as they are not necessarily web-oriented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Linked Building Data Working Group will determine how building-related information such as product catalogues or building appliances can best be made better available on the Web and integrated with other data such that machines and people can discover them.
      </p>
      <p>The Building Data on the Web Best Practices document will summarize the set of identified best practices. This will include advices to adopt the <a href="https://5stardata.info/en/">5 stars deployment scheme for Data on the Web</a>. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Building Topology ontology (BOT) (Recommendation)</h3>
      <p>Designing, planning, constructing and maintaining a building are tasks that involve multiple stakeholders each having their own interpretations and requirements for the common dataset. Furthermore, each stakeholder consumes, processes and manipulates information about the building during it's full life cycle.</p>
      <p>Several industries have interfaces to the construction industry and buildings in particular without this being their main industry. As there is often a need to describe some sensor, product, device in the context of the building in which it sits and as the building is itself also a feature of interest in the context of a smart city, there is a demand for a minimal, extendable ontology that describes anything in its context of a building.</p>
      <p>The Linked Building Data Working Group will publish the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) as a minimal ontology for defining relationships between the sub-components of a building.</p>
      <p>This document will also discuss how it can be used together with other standards (IFC, GeoSPARQL, Semantic Sensor Network, PROV-O ...), and separate initiatives (schema.org, Haystack, BRICK, ...)</p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h3>Product and Property Evaluation ontology (Recommendation)</h3>
      <p>Core concepts such as Features of Interest (FoI), their Properties, and the evaluation of these Properties, are being regularly redefined by standards and initiatives inside and outside the W3C and the building domain. Examples include <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/"><abbr title="Semantic Sensor Network Ontology">SOSA/SSN</abbr></a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/auto/wg/">Automotive Working Group</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/smart-appliances">ETSI SAREF</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, <a href="http://bsdd.buildingsmart.org/">BSDD</a>.</p>
      <p>The Linked Building Data Working Group will publish the Product and Property Evaluation Ontology as a minimal ontology for defining features of interest, their properties, and assign values to the properties of features of interest. Three levels of description are envisioned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>L1: the FoI is directly linked to the value for one of its properties <pre>&lt;room> ex:temperature "21.3 DEG"^^cdt:ucum</pre></li>
        <li>L2: there is an indirection between the FoI and the value for its property
        <pre>&lt;room> ex:hasProperty &lt;room#temperature> .
&lt;room#temperature> a ex:TemperatureProperty ;
  ex:value "21.3 DEG"^^cdt:ucum .</pre> </li>
        <li>L3: there is an additional indirection between the property and the value for this property
        <pre>&lt;room> ex:hasProperty &lt;room#temperature> .
&lt;room#temperature> a ex:TemperatureProperty ;
  ex:evaluation &lt;room#current-temperature> . 
&lt;room#current-temperature> a ex:PropertyEvaluation ;
  ex:value "21.3 DEG"^^cdt:ucum .</pre> </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Also, the Product and Property Evaluation Ontology will describe upper-level classes for Products, which can commonly be modeled as individual products, generic products, or manufacturer products, but could also be modeled as product categories or product placeholders. <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> only considers the first three categories of products.</p>
      <p>This document will also discuss how it can be used together with other standards (IFC, GeoSPARQL, Semantic Sensor Network, ...), and separate initiatives (schema.org, Haystack, BRICK, ...)</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Building-specific taxonomy of products, and properties (Note)</h3>
      <p>The Linked Building Data Working Group will publish a taxonomy of common building-related products and properties, defined as specializations of the lightweight domain independent ontologies and exposed following the devised best practices.</p>
      <p>This document will also discuss how it can be used together with other standards (IFC, GeoSPARQL, Semantic Sensor Network, ...), and separate initiatives (schema.org, Haystack, BRICK, ...)</p>

    <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Best Practice Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, evidence will be adduced that each of the best practices have been followed or recommended in at least two environments.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Ontology Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, evidence will be adduced that each term in the vocabulary has been used in multiple environments.

    <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a title="Technical Architecture Group" href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a title="First Public Working Draft" href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsWD">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a title="Candidate Recommendation" href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsCR">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
    <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      <h3>Relationship with BuildingSMART International</h3>
      <p>The Linked Building Data Working Group will communicate with <a href="http://www.buildingsmart.org/">buildingSMART</a> International, which is the standardization body behind IFC, and in particular with the <a href="http://buildingsmart.org.gridhosted.co.uk/?p=4911">Linked Data Working Group (LDWG)</a> in buidingSMART International. </p>
        <!--The outcomes of the LDWG and this Linked Building Data WG will nevertheless be different, as only the latter specifically aims at web-oriented data standards, which requires a different set-up than is currently in place in buildingSMART International. Strong alignment is nevertheless sought in the content. Formally, each standards body has established its own group with its own charter and operates under the respective organization's rules of membership. The two groups will work together very closely and create a set of outputs that are complementary in purpose and nature (oriented either towards a web development market or towards the construction industry market), and that are expected to be adopted as standards by W3C and buildingSMART separately.-->

        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
      <p>
         However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

        A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

        If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
