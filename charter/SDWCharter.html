<h1 id="title">Building Data on the Web Working Group Charter</h1>

<p>Vast amounts of heterogeneous data are generated and used during the <b>life cycle of a building</b>. An example type of data are product data, which describe the building and the elements that make up the building. These include walls, windows, pipes, ducts, light switches, sensors and several devices. Starting from these data, and through their connection to more fine-grained data, such as sensor measurements data, usage data, intelligent domotic system data, geographical data, weather data, highly advanced services can be supplied over the web to the diverse end users. Several data models (some of which are standards) currently exist which capture aspects of the building and support making the data available to applications. Examples are the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), SAREF, DogOnt, QUDT, etc. However, these data currently often sit in fragmented silos, making it difficult to develop applications to access and integrate them. Furthermore, where data is available, they may be represented in structures or formats which further inhibit ease of re-use, as they are not necessarily web-oriented. 
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Building Data on the Web Working Group</b> aims to make building data better available on the web. It aims to achieve this through the development of a simplified reference building ontology which is based on existing schemas for building data such as the ones above. The Building Data on the Web Working Group will develop a small core set of concepts and properties which are essential for describing buildings and which can be published as reference building data on the web. This core set of concepts will focus on <b>building topology and building product data</b>, while leaving out geometric data, sensor data, geographic data and other data, as these data are already in scope for other W3C Working Groups. 
</p>
<p>
    We envisage that this approach is essential to exploiting building data on the web for a range of important use cases, including those related to indoor navigation (e.g. shop navigation, evacuation and disaster, etc.), energy efficiency simulation (e.g. retrofitting, behavioural change, etc.), web-based facility management, and many more. This data will allow building owners and companies to publish quality building data on the web in a structured way, making the development of new and novel applications possible. For a complete list of use cases, please see the section on use cases.
</p>

<p> <!--Several  LDAC, LBD and VoCamp communities <a href="">(reports)</a> workshops have already recognized that many 
relevant standards already exist <a href="">(link to standards)</a> . With these factors in mind,-->
The <strong>mission</strong> of the Building Data on the Web Working Group group is to clarify and formalize the relevant standards landscape.
In particular:</p>

<ol>
<li>to determine how building information can best be integrated with other data on the Web;</li>
<li>to determine how machines and people can discover that different facts in different 
datasets relate to the same building, especially when 'building' is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity;</li>
<li>to identify and assess existing methods and tools and then create a set of best practices for their use;</li>
<li>where desirable, to complete the standardization of informal technologies already in widespread use.</li>
</ol>

        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>The main objective of the Building Data on the Web Working Group is to enable all stakeholders in the 
            building life cycle to access and query required data to support their business use cases using web technologies. Its scope is then Web technologies as they may be applied to buildings (products, geometry, usage, topology).
			<!--The Building Data on the Web WG is closely related to existing standardisation bodies and initiatives. The Building Data on the Web WG will be part of the Data Activity and is explicitly chartered to work in collaboration with BuildingSMART International, in particular, the Linked Data Working Group (LDWG).-->
        </p>
        <p>
            Where relevant, it will promote Linked Data using the 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> paradigm, but 
            this will not be to the exclusion of other technologies.

        <h2 id="noscope">Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>The Building Data on the Web Working Group must be mindful of the needs of front end Web developers,
        however, it will not develop any 3D geometric modelling or rendering technologies as they are available in common-place Building Information Modelling (BIM) or 3D geometric modelling tools. Geospatial data is out of scope as it is in the scope of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">W3C Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

        <p>The titles of the deliverables are not final; the Working Group will
          have to decide on the final titles as well as the structures of the
          documents. The Working Group may also decide to merge some
          deliverables into one document or produce several documents that
          together constitute one of the deliverables. <!--The ontologies of interest 
          are linked to several data domains identified within the context of the

        <p>The Building Data on the Web Working Group will communicate with <a href="http://www.buildingsmart.org/">buildingSMART</a> International, which is the standardization body behind IFC, and in particular with the <a href="http://buildingsmart.org.gridhosted.co.uk/?p=4911">Linked Data Working Group (LDWG)</a> in buidingSMART International. The outcomes of the LDWG and this Building Data on the Web WG will nevertheless be different, as only the latter specifically aims at web-oriented data standards, which requires a different set-up than is currently in place in buildingSMART International. Formally, each standards body has established its own group with its own charter and operates under the respective organization's rules of membership. The 'two groups' will work together very closely and create a set of outputs that are complementary in purpose and nature (oriented either towards a web development market or towards the construction industry market), and that are expected to be adopted as standards by W3C and buildingSMART separately.</p>

        <h3>W3C Groups</h3>
        <p>As well as collaborating with the Linked Data Working Group (LDWG) in BuildingSMART International, 
        the Building Data on the Web Working Group will be responsible for liaising with the following W3C groups.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp">Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a></dt>
          <dd>Coordinate on best practices, especially in areas of potential overlap.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/spatial">Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a></dt>
          <dd>Ensure that the WG operates complementary to the activities of the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group.</dd>
          <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">Internationalization Activity</a></dt>
          <dd><span>Ensure that multilinguality concerns are properly reflected in
              the best practices</span>. The WG should also take note of the work of the
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/bpmlod/">Best Practices for Multilingual Linked Open Data</a> Community Group.</dd>
          <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/Privacy/">Privacy Interest Group</a></dt>
          <dd>Ensure that the privacy concerns are properly included in the best practices.</dd>
          <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/data/CG/wiki/Main_Page">Data Activity Coordination Group</a></dt>
          <dd>Ensure that the WG operates in cooperation with others working in related fields.</dd>
          <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things Interest Group</a></dt>
          <dd>Ensure that the WG takes into account best practices proposed by this Interest Group to enable a connection with the Internet of Things (IoT).</dd>
        </dl>
     

      <h3 id="projects">Other Groups &amp; Projects</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/"><abbr title="Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community">INSPIRE</abbr></a></dt>
        <dd>The community and standards around the European INSPIRE Directive are an important reference point for the Working Group.</dd>
      </dl>

      <div id="conformance">
        <p>Furthermore, the Building Data on the Web Working Group expects to follow these W3C Recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/">QA Framework: Specification Guidelines</a>.</li>

        </ul>

    <div class="participation">
      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
      <p>To be successful, the Building Data on the Web Working Group is
        expected to have 20 or more active participants for its duration. To get
        the most out of this work, participants should expect to devote several
        hours a week; for budgeting purposes, we recommend at least half a day a
        week. For chairs and document editors the commitment will be higher,
        say, 1-2 days a week. Participants who follow the work less closely
        should be aware that if they miss decisions through inattention further
        discussion of those issues may be ruled out of order. However, most
        participants follow some areas of discussion more closely than others,
        and the time needed to stay in good standing therefore varies from week
        to week. The Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources
        for building Test Suites for each specification.</p>

    <div class="decisions">
      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
          3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
        consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after
        due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a
        decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
        <br>
        <br>
        A formal vote should allow for remote asynchronous participation-using,
        for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques. Any resolution
        taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered
        provisional until 5 working days after the publication of the resolution
        in draft minutes sent to the group's mailing list. </p>
      <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
          3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
        procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
