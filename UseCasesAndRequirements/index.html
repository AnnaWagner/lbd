      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/">Linked Building Data Community Group</a>, as described in its <a href="https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/lbd/charter/">charter</a>, is to enable all stakeholders in the building life cycle to access and query required data to support their business use cases using web technologies. Its scope is then Web technologies as they may be applied to buildings (products, geometry, usage, topology). Infrastructure data (bridges, roads, railroads).
      </p>
      <p>This document describes the results of the first steps of working towards this goal. Members of the Community Group and other stakeholders have come up with a number of <a href="#UseCases">use cases</a> that describe how linked data can be used in the building life cycle. From these use cases, a number of <a href="#Requirements">requirements</a> for further work are derived. In this document, use cases, requirements and their relationships are described. Requirements and use cases are also related to the <a href="#Deliverables">deliverables</a> of the Community Group.</p>
      <p>The requirements described in this document will be the basis for development of the other deliverables of the Community Group.</p>

    <section id="Methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>In order to find out the requirements for the deliverables of the Community Group, use cases were collected. For the purpose of the Community Group, a use case is a story that describes challenges with respect to linked building data for existing or envisaged information systems. It does not need to adhere to certain standardized format. Use cases are primarily used as a source of requirements, but a use case could be revisited near the time the work of the Community Group will reach completion, to demonstrate that it is now possible to make the use case work.</p> 
      <p>The Community Group has derived requirements from the collected use cases. A requirement is something that needs to be achieved by one or more deliverables and is phrased as a specification of functionality. Requirements can lead to one or more tests that can prove whether the requirement is met.</p>
      <p>Care was taken to only derive requirements that are considered to in scope for the further work of the Community Group. The scope of the Community Group is determined by the <a href="https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/lbd/charter/">charter</a>. To help keeping the requirements in scope, the following questions were applied:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Is the requirement specifically about building data?</li>
      <li>Is the use case including data published, reused, and accessible via Web technologies?</li>
      <li>Has a use case a description that can lead to a testable requirement?</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="UseCases">
      <!--A HTML template for use cases can be found at the end of this section -->
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Use cases that describe current problems or future opportunities for Linked Building Data have been gathered as a first activity of the Community Group. They were mainly contributed by members of the Group, but there were also contributions from other interested parties. In this chapter these use cases are listed and identified. Each use case is related to one or more Community Group <a href="#Deliverables">deliverables</a> and to one or more <a href="#Requirements">requirements</a> for future deliverables.</p>

          <p>Ordnace Survey Ireland (OSi) has a large data base of geospatial objects (buildings IDs, geolocation, polygons, form and function), including over 3.5 million buildings in the Rep. of Ireland.
          Roscommon Co Council collects/maintains similar data (usages, mainteance) about their buildings. This results in
            decentralized national data whereby the appropriate authorities maintain their own data sets. 
            Adapt is working with both OSi and RosCoCo to support interlinking of these data sets, in particular around a set of 
            published URIs provided by OSi for each building in Ireland. </p>
          <p>Using LD each stakeholder maintains their own (sub-)dataset and the whole grows more comprehensive and interlinked with no need for duplication of effort.
          This use case can be further extended to include other data sets, including historic building data, and more advance 3D building models.</p>

          <p>CSTB needs to check buildings againts building regulation. The idea is to take an IFC file, execute a rule and return a BCF as result including the elements Ids that are not valid. </p>
          <p>Sometimes, the element level is not accurate enough to express the result. The reason is that some part of the element can be valid, some other part not valid. Let's take the example of a corridor with multiple aisles. The corridor is modeled with only one Space but each aisle can have its own width. This way some aise can have a sufficient width while others can be not valid. </p>
          <p>This idea is to be able to break an element into parts with their own geometry, to be able to identify each part and let's each part have their own properties.This use case address various deliverables.</p>

          <p>CSTB needs to check buildings models againts regulation. Each control point is written as a semanctic rule. Those control points can deal with objet properties, object relations and/or object geometry. </p>
          <p>Whereas objects, properties, geometry and direct relation are explicit within the model, topological relations are most of the time implicit and need to be processed. For instance, we need to know if to spaces are adjacent and to get informations about the exchange surface (nature, surface). Thoses operations on geometry can be performed by some triplestore that integrate semantic topological functions such as those defined by the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standards. </p>
          <p>Here we have to find the right level of detail for this kind of operations. Too poors  (such as bounding box) and the results are wrong, too accurate (BREP : Boundary representation with triangles) and the amount of calcutation turns far too heavy. The challenge would be to find the right kind of geometrical representation and minimum level of details we need to infer topological relations between models elements.</p>

          <p>CSTB needs to performs model checking against French building code. We assume that all the information needed is included in the building model. Thus we can apply queries or rules in order to check a specific control point.</p>
          <p>In some cases it necessary to materialize requierements by creating specific object, with properties and geometry. For instance, the regulation say that accessible doors should be have enough free space in front of them to permit operation for people in wheelchair. The geometrical property of the free space are described too. In such a case it could be interesting to materialize this kind of free space to be able to infer on it. </p>
          <p>In terms of ontology, we need to be able to create and identifiy an objet that is not part of the building but only materialize a requirement. The same need could be derived for requierment properties and the way to distinguish them from the inner properties.</p>

Possibility to define it as system consisting from many parts (products or other subsystems (other products)) will give additional value to the quality of processes such : concept description, optimalisation, promotion. System design, system tendering, updating the changes or comparing the system with other diagrams from possible databbase of these schemas => possible way to error-check of HVAC system schema and avoiding design errors. Possible way to analyze actual trends in HVAC systems if adequate database will be built as time passes.

          <p>It is reasonable to be able to ask about data property (data space) of specific product. Example given : You have found on web three types of heat-pumps on market. You want to use either heat pump which has performance data defined analytically - in polynoms, or heat pump which has performance data set on cube matrix. That means you will avoid selection of the heat-pumps with COP as "only one number" value.  The answer of the data property query shall exactly define the character of the data and its volume-range.  It is reasonable to count with possibility, that data may have even N-dimensional form comparing to easily understandable 3-dimensional form of data -> where can be on the first data connected other properties based on specific equations.</p>

          <h3>Multi-Functional Facade Components</h3>
          <p class="contributor">Anna Wagner, <a href="http://www.iib.tu-darmstadt.de/willkommen/index.en.jsp">TU Darmstadt</a>.</p>

          <p>Within the research project "Solar Construction Processes" (SolConPro), the holistic integration of multi-functional facade components (such as energy active facades) is investigated. The developed approach includes the application of Semantic Web Technologies for describing complex product data. For further information on the research project and considered approach see <a href="http://www.solconpro.de">http://www.solconpro.de</a> .</p>
          <p>Currently, descriptions of multi-functional facade components are exchanged in personal manner via telephone or mail. This is based on the absence of an exchange format allowing a dynamic and full description of such products. Therefore, manufacturers offer data sheets containing different information and naming of attributes for every product, impeding their application by non-experts. To facilitate planners in working with these products, a flexible and unified product description schema is necessary.</p>
          <p>Multi-functional components present various challenges towards product descriptions. First, the products do not resemble only one product category, but can be considered as individuals of multiple categories (e.g. facade element, PV component, and window). Thereby, it must be possible to classify one component with different product categories. Second, the varying usage of innovative technologies cause products of the same category to hold diverging properties, requiring to drop template based approaches, as no singular template describing all products of such a category can be created. Third, as coherences between geometrical and non-geometrical information may occur, describing both within one schema allows an easier depiction of such relationships.</p>

          <p>In the Architecture, Construction and Engineering (AEC) domain numerous formats exist to enable electronic exchange of data related to products stemming from the domain. For example the following non-exhaustive list has been gathered: FreeClassOWL, BauDataWeb, eClassOWL, UNSPSC, proficl@ss, omniclass, BAUKOM, PPBIM, VDI3805 and ISO757, CoClass (Sweden), ISO12006-2, NIST PDTO, NBS PDT, VVS Kataloget - National, Denmark, BNL - National, Netherlands.</p>
          <p>From this heterogeneity a number of problems arise:<p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implementing an adapter to each format is impossible for tool vendors</li>
            <li>Economically it is not affordable for building product manufacturers to publish their product data in each of the formats</li>
            <li>The product data can be available for one kind of products in one format and in a different one for another. Querying both is difficult when published in different formats.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Large engineering projects require extensive public or private capital expenditures and other resources. They are also subjected to a variety of unique factors and therefore having different risk exposures. The current method of quantifying these risk exposures are quite subjective to fields, firms and even regions. The main way to increase objectivity is by trying to come up with objective statistical base rates for various aspects of these projects. The problem is that the data that is required to do so is often not available. Although many companies and governmental agencies report their data on their large engineering projects, there is not a broad consensus around definitions. This makes many of the research that is done on projects subjected to various biases and definitions within their data sets. Another problem is that this abundance of project data is usually in the form of reports and tables. These problems make this a unique use case area for promoting interoperability through semantic web. Uniform Project Ontology aims to unify the risk characteristics of these projects through the lens of capital investment. </p>

This use case provides a method for identifying and reporting faults or unwanted behaviour (e.g. too much heating), and provides access to information regarding potential replacement devices along with cost/benefit analysis. Faults in buildings can be difficult to detect and can often go unreported. Facility Managers must detect faults themselves, or rely on occupants to report faults, either by word (in person or through a reporting desk), by e-mail or by phone. This use case is concerned with providing capabilities for sensors to report faults, or where sensors are not present, support occupants to identify and report the location of a fault/unwanted behaviour in a building (3D floor plan) using a web browser on a mobile device, or desktop. This information is then presented to the FM, who can quickly locate, assess and if required address the issue. The FM is provided with tools to identify replacements, compare costs and control building set points. </p></div>

These suggestion are based on rules developed through data mining and predictive energy simulation. To achieve this use case an energy simulation is first created for the building (if not already developed during design). Parallel, data is gathered from all available sensor systems relevant to energy consumption. Data mining is conducted over the sensed data and a rule set is developed in conjunction with the predictive energy simulations (to account for incomplete data from sensors). Next, the dynamic sensor data is provided as parameters to a near-real time controller which based on the rule set, provides suggestions to the FM through a visualisation interface.</p></div>
